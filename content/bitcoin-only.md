title: "Bitcoin Only"

It started with this tweet.

Altcoins are scams which waste time, money and provide an additional attack surface for any product / service which integrates them.

A website was needed that lists bitcoin only projects, so I built [bitcoin-only.com](https://bitcoin-only.com).

Since then the project has grown significantly and now tracks a wide range of bitcoin information.

229 Days after launching bitcoin-only.com I moved the project to a dedicated GitHub repo and made it OpenSource under the MIT License. Within minutes of announcing the move to GitHub I had merged a pull request!

This will allow the site to grow at a faster rate, with supporters of the project being able to contribute directly, rather than through DM's & emails.

The current workflow is as follows;
- Those proposing additions/alterations to the project open an issue or make a pull request
- If it is a pull request I review it and merge it if it meets the requirements
- If it is an issue someone (myself unless someone else beats me to it) opens a pull request which is then assessed.
