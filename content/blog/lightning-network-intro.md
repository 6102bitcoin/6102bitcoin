## What is lightning?

Instant & cheap bitcoin transactions.

## How can I try lightning?

An easy way to try the lightning network. Just visit tippin.me and sign up. Use a bitcoin lightning wallet such as [lightning-wallet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lightning.walletapp) on android. On iOS there is [thin wallet](https://www.lndthinwallet.com/) but that is not yet opensource. Follow the instructions in the app you download to create a payment channel and send some satoshis to your tippin.me account.

## Why is it useful?

You can pay by lightning on a [growing number of websites](http://lightningnetworkstores.com/#).

You could try reading a post on [yalls.org](https://yalls.org/) or buy a phone voucher on [bitrefill](https://www.bitrefill.com/).
You could also try sending me some satoshis by visiting my tippin page, [tippin.me/@6102bitcoin](https://tippin.me/@6102bitcoin).
