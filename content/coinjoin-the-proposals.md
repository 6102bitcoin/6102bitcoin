title: "CoinJoin. Part 2: The Proposals"
---

Summarizing each Proposal for the CoinJoin Bounty.

_This summary is focused on the Proposals/Projects which came out of that thread. For a summary of all the key points in the thread see_ [_Part I_](/coinjoin-the-bounty-thread)_._

_Background_
============

_The CoinJoin Bounty BitcoinTalk thread was was started by Greg Maxwell back in 2013 in order to encourage development of implementations of CoinJoin. A 2of3 multisig_ [_donation address_](https://blockstream.info/address/3M8XGFBKwkf7miBzpkU3x2DoWwAVrD1mhk) _was created by Greg, Theymos and Pieter Wuille which was/is to be used to encourage development. As of today (2019–04–07) no payment has ever been made from this address (except to consolidate funds when fees were low). A recent_ [_comment_](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/b8xgz7/nopara73_reapplies_for_the_46_btc_bounty_for_his/ek95nbo/) _by Theymos suggest that there may be payouts from the donated funds which now total 46.4 BTC (over $200k) — watch this space!_

Introduction
============

This article summarizes the key proposals made in the CoinJoin Bounty thread which has been the focal point for CoinJoin development over the past 6 years. If you have screenshots of the Proposals which are missing them please get in touch [on keybase](https://keybase.io/6102).

Summary
-------

There are 13 proposals which I have identified from the thread. If you think I have missed any please let me know. The purpose of encouraging development of easy to use CoinJoin tools is to **make bitcoin more private**.

Privacy is not an ugly word. You wouldn’t want everyone to be able to read your mail, similarly you don’t want everyone to know what bitcoin you own.

Proposal I: ‘coinjoin’  
Proposal II: ‘BitPrivacy’  
Proposal III: ‘coinjoin’

_Note: Though Wasabi is the most impressive work nopara73 has done regarding CoinJoin he has made_ **_many_** _other contributions to bitcoin privacy. These are detailed in the bounty post. Furthermore, the Follow-up Post details the many improvements to the software which took place since the Bounty Post._

Thanks For Reading!
===================

So much progress! I hope that one day soon some of these developers will be rewarded for their efforts in the form of payouts from the bounty address.

MORE?!
======

Yes. There were a few things which, though not coded proposals were too interesting not to mention. Enjoy!

Bonus I: CoinJoin Presentation

**Bonus II: OXT.me origin**
===========================

2014–06–06 | [Bounty Post](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=279249.msg7170950#msg7170950)

Dev: laurentmt

Thoughts on transaction entropy and address identification. This later manifested itself as [oxt.me](https://oxt.me) — an powerful blockchain explorer

Bonus IV: JoinMarket Origin
===========================

2014–10–30 | [Bounty Post](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=279249.msg9384411#msg9384411)

Dev: belcher

It is clear that the this post directly led to the creation of JoinMarket

> Proposal: Pay the coinjoin makers. They will put up offers to do coinjoin along with a fee they ask. The coinjoin transaction would be built up in a similar way to the above example, with the coinjoin maker fee being added to the associated change address and taken away from the coinjoin taker’s change address.

Bonus V: Compact Confidential Transactions
==========================================

2015–06–12 | [Bounty Post](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=279249.msg11599760#msg11599760) | [Announcement Post](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1085436.msg11597427)

Dev: mixles

A pdf was posted detailing mixles work on Compact Confidential Transactions which greg described as super exciting and important \[[link](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1085436.msg11646936#msg11646936)\], though there was no code. A problem was identified by Andrew Poelstra which resulted in the proofs being less compact than initially hoped.
