| --    | --         | --            | --            |
| A | Non-technical Beginner | Free, Easy and Quick | When your computer is off your node will not be running so when you do want to use it you will have to wait for it to sync.|
| B | Technical Enthusiast | Free | Requires significant time to setup & is technologically difficult if you have not used linux before.|
| C | Less Technical Enthusiast | Reasonably low cost & quick | Requires some time to setup though typically guides specify hardware making setup as simple as following instructions precisely. |
| D | Anyone who can comfortably afford this option | Quick and Easy | High cost compared to alternatives |
