I agreed completely, I am passionate about bitcoin, not scam altcoins which waste time, money and provide an additional attack surface for any product / service which dabbles with them.
I thought, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be great to have a website which lists only bitcoin only projects!
That day I built bitcoin-only.com.
Since then the project has grown significantly and now tracks a wide range of bitcoin tools, products, events and services."/>

<p>I agreed completely, I am passionate about bitcoin, not scam altcoins which waste time, money and provide an additional attack surface for any product / service which dabbles with them.</p>
<p>I thought, wouldn&rsquo;t it be great to have a website which lists only bitcoin only projects!</p>
<p>That day I built <a href="https://bitcoin-only.com">bitcoin-only.com</a>.</p>
<p>Since then the project has grown significantly and now tracks a wide range of bitcoin tools, products, events and services.</p>

<p>229 Days after launching bitcoin-only.com I moved the project to a dedicated GitHub repo and made it OpenSource under the MIT Lisence.</p>
<p>This had always been a long term goal, and I was delighted to finally be able to accept pull requests directly. Within minutes of announcing the news on twitter I had merged a pull request!</p>
<p>Going forwards this will allow the site to grow at a faster rate, with supporters of the project being able to contribute directly, rather than through DM&rsquo;s &amp; emails.</p>
<p>The current workflow is as follows;</p>
<ul>
<li>Those proposing additions/alterations to the project open an issue or make a pull request</li>
<li>If it is a pull request I review it and merge it if it meets the requirements</li>
<li>If it is an issue someone (myself unless someone else beats me to it) opens a pull request which is then assessed.</li>
</ul>
